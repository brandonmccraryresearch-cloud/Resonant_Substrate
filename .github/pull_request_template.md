## 🔴 MANDATORY: Theoretical Correspondence Compliance

**BEFORE MERGING, ALL ITEMS MUST BE CHECKED ✅**

Refer to: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Theoretical Correspondence Mandate Section)

### 1. Formula Completeness
- [ ] **All formulas cite IRH v24.0 manuscript** (Section, Equation)
- [ ] **No oversimplifications** - complete formulas with ALL terms included
- [ ] **Corrections included** where applicable
- [ ] **Approximations justified** with explicit error bounds (e.g., "O(ε²) where ε << 1")
- [ ] **No hardcoded constants** - all values derived from first principles

**Example of CORRECT citation:**
```python
def derive_fine_structure_constant() -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Derive α⁻¹ from Hopf fibration optimization.
    
    Theoretical Reference:
        IRH v24.0, §2.2
        
    Formula (Complete):
        α⁻¹ = 137.036 from Hopf S³→S² optimization
        
    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[float, float]
        (alpha_inverse, uncertainty)
    """
```

### 2. Transparency Engine Integration
- [ ] **TransparencyEngine used** for all new computations
- [ ] **Step-by-step derivation logs** emitted
- [ ] **Component-by-component breakdown** provided
- [ ] **Provenance tracking** implemented
- [ ] **Validation checks** included (dimensional consistency)

**Example usage:**
```python
from src.logging import TransparencyEngine, FULL

engine = TransparencyEngine(verbosity=FULL)
engine.info("Computing Harmony Functional H[Ψ]", reference="§1.1")
engine.step("Step 1: Computing kinetic term")
engine.value("kinetic", kinetic_value, uncertainty=1e-12)
engine.passed("Computation complete")
```

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- [ ] **Function docstrings** follow NumPy style with theoretical references
- [ ] **Type hints** provided for all parameters and returns
- [ ] **Error handling** appropriate for all edge cases
- [ ] **Dimensional consistency** verified
- [ ] **Known limits checked** where applicable

### 4. Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit tests added** for all new functions
- [ ] **Integration tests** for cross-module functionality
- [ ] **Theoretical validation tests** against known results
- [ ] **All existing tests still pass** (100% required)
- [ ] **Test coverage** maintained or improved

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **README.md** updated if user-facing changes
- [ ] **docs/api_reference/** updated if API changes
- [ ] **Notebooks updated** if computational changes
- [ ] **Manuscript citations** verified and accurate
- [ ] **No contradictions** with existing documentation

## 🟡 Audit Protocol Compliance

Refer to: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Mandatory Audit Protocol Section)

### Pre-Merge Verification
- [ ] **Imports verified** - all modules import successfully
- [ ] **Tests passing** - `pytest tests/ -v` shows 100% pass rate
- [ ] **No circular reasoning** in derivations
- [ ] **Dependencies managed** appropriately
- [ ] **Version numbers** accurate

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] **Technical risks** identified and documented
- [ ] **Theoretical risks** evaluated
- [ ] **Maintenance risks** assessed
- [ ] **Mitigation strategies** proposed

## 🚨 Rejection Criteria (Will NOT be merged if any apply)

**Code will be REJECTED if:**
1. ❌ Missing manuscript citations
2. ❌ Simplified formulas without error bounds
3. ❌ Black box computations without transparency logs
4. ❌ Hardcoded constants without derivation
5. ❌ Unjustified approximations
6. ❌ Test failures
7. ❌ Breaking changes to existing APIs without justification

## 📚 Manuscript Correspondence

### Equations Implemented
<!-- List all equations from IRH v24.0 manuscript implemented in this PR -->
- **§2.2** (Fine-structure constant): Implemented in `src/hopf/alpha_derivation.py`
- **§1.1** (Harmony Functional): Updated in `src/substrate/harmony.py`

### Theoretical Justification
<!-- Explain how changes maintain theoretical consistency -->

This PR implements the derivation of α⁻¹ from Hopf fibration optimization,
completing the chain: M_Pl → G_inf^4 → Hopf S³→S² → KAM phase-locking → φ → α.
The implementation includes:
1. Complete SU(2) parameterization
2. KAM theory phase-locking for golden ratio
3. Variational optimization for α
4. Error bounds from discretization
